If you are in a different conversations (perhaps drivers that are hyper concerned about safety) then maybe you should focus on that compentency and seperate yourself from the pack"

       " 'comment1077': 'there are two methods of repairing punctures . one is to plug it . that requires reaming out the hole and pushing a plug from the outside of the tire through the original puncture to the inside . the plug is saturated with rubber glue . this works most of the time but it is not the preferred way to do it . the major advantage is that you dont need to remove the tire from the rim although you probably should remove it from the car . the disadvantage is that you cant prepare the inside of the tire and it might not hold as well . some think it will eventually give way so it is not considered by some to be anything but an emergency procedure which can be done on the side of the road . the preferred way is to remove the tire scrape all foreign material from the inside of the tire where the hole was and then patch it from the inside by pulling a plug that has a patch behind it from the inside out . then the patch itself is rolled with a tool that really makes it stick . with this method preparation is the key . as anyone that has tried to glue anything can tell you it doesnt always work if the surface to be glued is dirty or has some foreign matter on it . another problem is if the hole is not right in the middle of the tread then the patch will have to bend in the shape of the tire and it is much harder to roll the patch . with both methods some form of rubber and glue comes out the hole and either wears off level with the tread or is cut off and then wears off . this could have the appearance of glue or stickum because the plug is made of soft rubber to conform to the hole . it is not always possible to patch holes in tires although the ones you cant patch are few and far between . they may be doing the best they can but if they did not tell you it was going to be really tough complain loudly and long and demand that they do right by you . what would be right i dont know but start with either fix it or give me a new tire if you have ruined it so it cant be fixed . be prepared to come down from that to keep fixing it but i think there is a limit to how many times you can let them fiddle around with it . go to a tire store and see what they say . you arent talking about the national debt or a tobacco lawsuit here . what could it cost to fix a tire 10 or 20 is not much for peace of mind . if you get it fixed somewhere else you should certainly demand your money back . they didnt do anything to earn it . on the other hand it isnt something to go to court about . good luck',\n",

in late december 2011 when it became clear that my 2001 acura tl might be heading for some expensive transmission repairs i went shopping for a new car . i wanted a coupe and it didnt take long to narrow down my list volvo s60 volkswagen cc audi a5 mercedes c250 infiniti g37 and bmw 328i . i toyed with the idea of the mini cooper clubman but since no one at my local mini dealership could be bothered to call me back regarding a testdrive i dropped it . with that short list in hand heres how my car buying went . from start to finish it took about a week . the research since i work at edmunds i had some inhouse resources on my side . i drove our longterm volvo s60 a number of times so i didnt need to testdrive it at a dealership . i got personal car recommendations from edmunds editors . i huddled with our consumer advice editors ron montoya and phil reed for shopping and negotiating strategies . car shopping is a lot more fun when its a team sport . its true that i had insiders to lean on but the tools i used the most were the ones available to any car shopper . in software development circles using your own product day in and day out is called eating your own dog food . thats what i did filled up on edmunds.com car chow . i read edmunds reviews of all the cars i was considering . i used our true market value and true cost to own information and reread most of our stories on negotiating . i also used our iphone app for athome and onthefly research . the testdrives as edmunds advises shoppers i made testdrive appointments through the internet departments of the various dealerships . i did stop by one dealership to scope out a car id seen on the dealer web site . the cpo volkswagen cc showed a sticker price that was 1000 higher than the price advertised on the site . that was just one more good reason to use the web . i did the bulk of my testdrives on the same day so my impressions would be fresh . the internet department sales folks who went on drives with me were polite laid back and wellversed in their cars . narrowing the list after the testdrives i spent a couple of days winnowing down my car list . once id driven the bmw and audi i didnt give the volvo s60 a second thought . too stodgy . the mercedes c250 just left me cold . cant say why but it did . the infiniti g37 didnt stay in contention long either . its a fine car but having once had an infiniti g20 and coming out of an 11year acura relationship i was ready for a little more of a drivers car . my top three picks all were german . cold logic warm heart the bmw 328i beat the audi a5 on price . it also won out because audi didnt offer a free vehicle maintenance program while bmw and volkswagen did . the volkswagen cc was not the usual car to crossshop with bmw and audi but i really liked its looks and the thrifty part of me was enticed by the price about 30000 for the lux trim level . ultimately i ruled it out because i preferred the 328is steering feel surefootedness responsiveness and power . it just won my heart . it won my head too once i decided on a 2011 bmw 328i . since i would be buying it at the end of december and at the end of 2011 i knew dealers would be motivated to make me a deal . musthaves i didnt want a lot of special stuff on the car but i did want navigation and heated front seats . i wasnt even that particular about interior and exterior color aside from being bored by silver after 11 years . my husband found a gorgeous montego blue metallic with saddle brown dakota leather . it came with the premium package which includes a universal garage door opener moonroof autodimming mirrors bmw assist with bluetooth lumbar support and a digital compass mirror and the value package consisting of power front seats and an ipodusb adapter . buying the car edmunds tmv price for the car was a little below the invoice price which edmunds listed as 40155. bmw said invoice price was 41165. the difference seems to be that bmw shows the automatic transmission as a 1375 option . edmunds shows it coming at no charge . msrp was 44050. the actual negotiation took about 15 minutes over the phone . i asked the excellent internet manager for mckenna bmw in norwalk calif. to give me her best price . based on the invoice price and tmv i already had decided that a good deal would be a price between 39500 and 40000. when she said 39995 i paused for just a minute . and then i said ok. there are some including my husband who negotiates for a living who would say that i should have pushed harder for a lower price . wheres the sense of victory unless theres a tussle over price i suppose i dont see car buying as combat . the salesperson had presented me with a price that was 4000 below msrp 150 below invoice and spoton when it came to tmv . i decided not to waste my breath for a few dollars more . if edmunds had price promise back then i definitely would have considered using it . the fi room like the price negotiation this was a relatively painless process . i did buy a 2000 extended warranty on the tires . id heard some unpleasant stories about the vulnerabilities of bmw runflat tires . plus the warranty offered coverage for wheel damage . im hard on wheels so i thought i would get my moneys worth . and so far that premise is proving true the cars wheels protrude a bit and are prone to curbing . ive had free repairs on three occasions and only two of those were my fault by the way . what i learned buying a car does not require months of research weeks of roaming car lots or hours of negotiation . if you

       " 'comment14090': 'like your husband suggested taking the first price a dealer offers even if it is from an internet manager rarely results in a best price . imho most dealers concoct an initial price offer which is low enough as to not result in the buyer walking but not their lowest price . for the internet savy buyer that price will likely be lower than the price for someone who just walks into the dealership . but that price is probably not the dealers lowest price . dealers know the internet savy buyer has done some research . dealers do not like research . however dealers anticipate a buyer even an internet savy buyer will haggle . so why not haggle a bit and good to remember that internet manager is under all her polished exterior a sales person . often a simple that seems a bit high let me think about it a bit will entice the dealer to offer a better price . a good negotiation tactic is to make the dealer believe its price is too high . the best way to accomplish that may be to make the dealer believe you are about to take a walkabout . two thousand dollars for wheel insurance numerous internet reviews suggest such insurance from a bmw dealer can be found for around 1300. imho 2000 to cover a possible wheel problem may not be a wise way to spend money . such pieceofmind products are always priced so the dealer and product provider not the buyer win . they know most people who purchase these products will not recover what they paid for the product . might be better advice to put the 2000 into an account where it would be available should a wheel issue arise but would also be available should no wheel issue materialize . as even edmunds advises all products offered in the box fi office are overpriced and of questionable value to most people . dealer fi managers really do not like us knuckleheads who refuse to buy those products . i have read they do refer to such buyers as knuckleheads .',\n",

       " 'comment15823': 'whats the thinking on the difference in power andor acceleration between having the sports chrono and doing the whateveritis kit that bumps the s from 355 hp to 381 hp 1 the 920 sports chrono doesnt officially add any hp or performance to the 911s . but with that faster throttle response the car sure feels a bit quicker and definitely more responsive . the same is true for the 2400 sport exhaust no official power increase but feels and sounds quicker . 2 the 16000 power kit adds 26 hp to the 911 s. thats 7. i havent seen any road tests nor have i driven one myself but that seems like a lot of money for a marginal increase in horsepower . and i seriously wonder if the actual performance difference would be as great as the perceived difference you get with the faster throttle response of sport chrono at 116th the cost . 3 if i had 16000 blowing a hole in my pocket to spend on more power id look in my other pocket for another 18000 and get a 480 hp 911 turbo . it stickers for 41k more than the 911s but includes standard features that would run an additional 57k on the 911s . like that not so great navigation system and bose sound.on a dollars per horsepower basis the 911 turbo makes a lot more sense 125 hp for 35k 280horse than the 911 s power kit 26 hp for 16k 615. and the best deal is going to the 911 s which gives you 30 more horsepower than the base for about 5.5k 183horse once you factor out the standard xenons 19 wheels pasm etc . my guess is that porsche figured that if there were power hungry financially challenged folks out there that were willing to spend 615 per horsepower for a power kit who are they to deny them that imprudence . oh and if you do find 18k in your other pocket for the turbo the 1950 sport chrono on that car is worth checking between your sofa cushions . it adds another 30 hp boost for short power bursts . yes don thats another bargain at only 65 per horse .',\n",
