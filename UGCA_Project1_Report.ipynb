       " 'comment17948': 'i have an 06 se v8 with the 18 inch tires . ive ordered new tires but they are not yet available and delivery is just dragging on and on . the only tires ive found that i like that will fit are the 2656018 goodyear wrangler silent armor which is 30.5 inches in diameter and the 2556018 general grabber at2 which is 30 inches in diameter the same as the factory tire . both are still back ordered indefinitely.heres my new plani like the nitto terra graplers but the only size id get is the 2856018 which is 31.4 inches in diameter . its been reported that these fit and dont rub except under excessive big dips at high speeds with a fully loaded truck not a situation that i couldnt avoid . but the spare tire is a very tight fit . there are 2 problems with the fit of the spare the diameter is too big and it would take a lot of shoving to get it in maybe even deairing the tire . even though i carry a compressor deairing would not be my first choice because if i leave it deaired my tire pressure warning light will come on . only choice would be to deair it put it in place and air it up . the other problem is the width of the tire . it would hit the towing reciever . but i found a fix for that . there are 2 rubber bumpers above the spare that can be removed and the tire can move up another half inch or so you do need to pad one of the spokes of the wheel so it doesnt hit the mechanism up there or orient the tire carefully.but heres my other idea buy 4 nitto terra grapplers of the 2856018 size and one any brand spare of the 2656018 size i.e the goodrich longtrail or the goodyear wrangler sra which are 30.5 inches in diameter . then if you need the spare the difference will only be 0.9 inches in diameter when the nittos are new and will be even less as the nittos wear down . most likely this will work until i can get the flat fixed . the 30.5 inch tire should fit under as a spare and the flat nitto would fit because it would be flat . another choice for the spare is the 2756018 size though this is less common . the michelin pilot ltx bridgestone dueler ht d684 and the dunlop grandtrek at23 come in this size . then the difference in diameters between the nittos and the spare would only be 0.5 inches when the nittos are new . it is 31 inches in diameeter and i think it would fit im going to have my local tire store air up any 31 inch tire so i can try it in my spare tire carrier to see if it fits . anybody out there got a 31 inch tire on a rim that they could try this it doesnt need to be an 18 inch wheel any size would work because we only care about the outside diameter fit.has anyone determined if a 17 inch discovery wheel will fit on an 18 inch lr3 if so that could be another option.what do you think of this plan',\n",
       " 'comment17978': 'can i ask what dealer you go to ive been told the same thing that the gy tire is not a good solution for this vehicle . i wonder if anyone on this board has had experience miles with either the nitto grappler or michelin syncrhones . those are the two suggested replacements .',\n",

       " 'comment2492': 'tires arent just tires . each tire is made for a specific purpose . remember the only thing in contact with the road are your vehicles tires unless of course your muffler happens to be dragging . never skimp on tires . its been posted before but seriously in an emergency a good set of tires can make the difference . tires are constructed from various types of rubbers and synthetic compounds that enhance wear and traction depending on the surface they were designed for . example winter tires are a softer rubber compound that holds its form in colder temperatures as well as usually having sipes and or larger spaced lugs to handle snow and ice.tires also have either steel or nylonpolyester belts or both for rigidity and strength . the bonding agents used to seal the rubber to these belts is also important . hot conditions can cause these bonds to weaken and fail as well as heavy loads although this process usually takes quite a bit of time to occur under stressfull driving conditions.being in the tractor trailer lease business we never skimp on our tires . you see quite a few truck tire carcasses on the roads usually because somebody tried to recap their tires one too many times or who purchased a low quality low cost tire to save a few bucks . the end result is that they spend more for road side assistance and replacement costs than to spend a few extra dollars up front for a better quality tire.keep the tires balanced and the vehicles alignment in place and you should get your monies worth and miles worth out of your tires .',\n",

       " 'comment5073': 'heres the scoopthere is a government standardized test that is supposed to be used to develop the treadwear rating for each tire . the test consists of a standard tire the same for every company and the test consists of a perscribed route on a pair of or more vehicles where the tires are swapped between vehicles to eliminate the vehicle effect.however the government allows the rating to be traceable to this test mainly to reduce the cost of testing particularly when the standard tire is a totally different size than the tire being compared to.add to this that there are different philosphies regarding the way this test should be applied to the rating . some companies are conservative in their rating and some are quite aggressive.and dont forget that sometimes a company might get great results on a given test but the rating might be out of line when compared to the rest of their lineup.so the key is that the ratings must be taken with a grain of salt maybe the whole shaker but that the rating has to be justifiable in other words a tire cant be rated beyond what the test results show.hope this helps .',\n",
       " 'comment5078': 'as explained above there is a standard dot tire a specific size and design i think it is a uniroyal that every tire company is supposed to compare to but circumstances may dictate that the comparison is made to some other tire usually something made by the tire company doing the testing . those circumstances include the problem of differing tire sizes availablility of the standard tire cost of testing etc.the net result is also filtered.its pretty complex and simple statements dont quite explain the situation adequately.now to explain why a tread wear rating might dramatically change while it is in production but with no apparent change in the tire itselfsometimes the first production runs are made before the testing actually takes place . in order to avoid hassles with the feds a conservative easily defendable rating will be applied then after the test is run the value will be changed.it is also possible that there was a change in compound . because rubber technology is constantly moving forward a breakthrough might be made that can improve one particular property such as wear without sacrficing another say wet traction.further sometimes the market will dictate that a change is needed in the compromise between 2 or more of the properties . for example original equipment tires are generally made with low rolling resistant compounds so the vehicle manufacturers can meet cafe requirements . when this tire is no longer supplied to the oem it will revert to the regular compound a rolling rsistance increase but an improvment in wear.hope this helps .',\n",

a reduction in ambient temperature of ten degrees will reduce tire pressure by one psi and so on . one psi change for every ten degrees f temperature change . this is an important safety issue when the seasons change or in the high desert and similar climes . see below…147 ;

       " 'comment5772': '1 once a tire is balanced it is balanced . it makes no difference if it is on the front or rear or left or right . the weight it takes to balance it is the weight it takes . the only thing that would affect the balance is adding material like snow being packed in the openings and taking material away unevenly like irregular wear which is caused by misalignment and aggravated by low inflation pressure and insufficient rotation practices.frequently rotating tires is a good way make sure that even small amounts of misalignment dont add up over time to irregular wear . imho there is no such thing as rotating too much except for the cost and amount of work put into the process.2 clipon balance weights are designed for both steel and alloy rims . for steel rims there is generally one 1 flange contour and a weight to match . for alloys there are about 5 different contours and weights to match those contours and some alloy rims cant accommodate clipon weights so stickons are the only option . based on your observations it looks like your wheels are such that clipons cant be used on the outside but the inside where it doesnt show was designed for clipon weights not unusual.3 yes heat will adversely affect treadwear but it is minor compared to misalignment and poor inflation practices . but the largest factor in treadwear is what i call tpm turns per mile . most tire wear occurs in the cornering mode so the more corners you turn and the harder you corner the more the wear on your tires . so if you drive mostly in the city and therefore make lots of turns you wont get as good of treadwear compared to someone who drives in the country.so to improve treadwear drive gently easy on the accerator and brakes and easy on the steering . hope this helps .',\n",

standard load tires and thats determined by the way the law is read not the way the tire is designed . different vehicle manufacturers have different philosphies regarding what gets put on the placard . it is either the mathematic equivalent or even you dont believe what you have said . or your calculation is incorrect which i personally do not think is a .yes i have been saying all along the 85 rules starting points are 354451. so i am glad you agree with what i am saying i do understand you disagree with the 85 concept . b. for example one oem tire that comes with a max tire wall pressure is michelin at 51 psi . so while i put 38 36 psi in on 44 psi max sidewalls if i had the michelins on the same car i would put 44 f 42 r psi . in fact the michelins come oem on a slightly upscale model the gls i know that you know this has more to do with stuff like sunroof leather seats cup holders etc vs the gl it does gives a higher psi on the placard so what gets put on the placard is set by the vehicle manufacturer . he considers many things and load on the tire is the primary thing . he could go with the large tire with low inflation or small tire high inflation and still get the same load capacity . using bottgers car as an example toyota could have used either of the 2 sizes this has happened before and chosen to use the inflation pressures as i calculated . im going to have to assume that toyota knows what it is doing and what is specified on the placard doesnt follow the 85 rule for either of the 2 possible pressures to be written on the sidewall . i usually assume the oem either knows what it is doing andor stands behind its technical data . that is another reason why i was a bit vexed by onesome of your earlier comments i.e that load has absolutely nothing to do with the psi ratings especially when the placard was extremely clear between half load and full load difference that is also if you have time i asked in a prior post if you would research a 2003 tdi jetta 195 65 15 h. current placard indicates 26 fr half load and 30 f 41 r full load . since this is the original tire size no research is needed . follow the placard . i will rarely overrule a vehicle manufacturer as theyve spent a lot of the time thinking and testing what they put there and if its wrong there will be a bunch of lawsuits i have been running 3836 f and 3634 r for 67k miles . thanks again . im curious why you would reverse the front rear pressure split . that would cause the vehicle to have less understeer but at the adhesion limit might result in the rear breaking loose first and i would think that never is a good thing to happen . yes to have the vehicle have less than the massive understeer that is designed into the car . it hangs very well at the limits of adhesion . will 26 in the fronts and rears prevent the rear end breaking loose over 38f 36 r absolutely not actually for this particular car the 3836 seems to be the sweet spot in terms of performance and handling for this car . also i tend to run at closer to autobahn speeds and a tad more pressure seems to flex and heat less . another spin off is the tread life seems to be a lot longer than what other folks with the same car and tire combo seem to get . just a thought ... ... ... .so in effect the overwhelming majority of consumers really do not benefit from the information if my experiences are any indication . ah but they do benefit first there are standards for a great many things bolts for example . and the guy on the shop floor doesnt have to know what kind he has so long as he is just taking them on and off . however if he breaks one then he needs to be able to interpret the markings on the head of the bolt so he gets the right one . but he doesnt need to know why and even what the standard is just be able to read the markings . the same is true for tires . if the guy on the shop floor can read the placard and he puts the same size tire on he doesnt need to know why and what the standard is . what could be simpler follow the placard in fact i didnt anticipate your advice to be any different in this case . howeverhaving come out of nuclear weapons design and maintainance i find that attitude or reasoning a tad scary . but i would agree with you that tires etc are way much less technically exacting . in fact when you compare it with the art and science of motorcycle tires and suspension we are in the stone age . however if he wants to change tire sizes well thats reengineering the vehicle and this is a bit too complex for the inexperienced wrench turner he should leave that to other more knowledgeable folks . i would agree one needs to have reasonable faith the calculations are correct and also the right calculations . i mean i consider it a good shop ... ... ... almost 9 of 10 times the pressures vary andor different from what they said it should be . usually 35 psi or 42 psi unfortunately many folks on the tire shop floor level are new to the working environment and or just have never been properly trained . this is somewhat aggravated by the constant pressure to reduce costs . sometimes this cost pressure results in shortcuts impact wrenches and calibrations being among them . actually your experience and take and my observations cut to the point i have been making . it is harder for consumers to benefit with so many obstacles which you are acquainted with at a professional level and me as a consumer observe . so if anything if the guy does put 3542 psi in the tire hes helping and is a minor miracle indeed that the consumer even gets that i was more impressed with costco ... ... ..trick to get in the cue for the costco gig i should mention that what they look up in the computer is the information that on the

       " 'comment6027': 'there is some validity in what was said but there is also some falsehood . first its hard to do apples to apples comparisons as the vehicle manufacturers have been moving towards higher speed ratings while theyve been going to lower aspect ratios . not only do you get better handling which is safer for the public but also using less of a tires capability or any product for that matter is also safer for the public.the vehicles have also been going larger in rim diameters and in a lot of ways the use of bigger brakes has been driving this also more safety for the publicbut to try to validate the issue on lower aspect ratio tires costing more i went to tirerack and looked up some prices on goodyears . heres what i foundp20575r15 97s 69 22 pounds 3.14 per poundp21570r15 97s 69 23 pounds 3.00 per poundp22560r16 97t 73 27 pounds 2.70 per poundall of these tires have the same load capacity and could be used in exactly the same application.this doesnt seem to follow the premise as the weight actually increased but the cost went down per pound.so lets start with the weight increase . as a tire goes lower in aspect ratio in order to keep the same load capacity and interestingly essentially the same diameter the section width increases . this means that the belts are wider the tread is wider and there is more ply material all increasing the weight . so if we take the change from p21570r15 to p22560r16 the only decrease in weight would come from the rim diameter change and thats only ply and sidewall material both fairly inexpensive materials the width increase adds quite a bit of material and therefore weight.so lets take a p23565r17 103s . same speed rating larger load capacity goodyear has one of those for 75 and it weighs 30 thats 2.50 per pound . however a pacifica requires an h speed rating and thats 135 29 pounds or 4.60 per pound but an h speed rated tire is going to have nylon on top of the belt . not only is this more material but it also requires more sophisticated and more expensive manufacturing equipment.i think the better arguement is that vehicles are coming with higher speed ratings and the lower aspect ratios are being driven by the increase in brake size not 100 but directionally . certainly the vehicle manufacturers have noticed the gradual increase in freeway speeds and are reacting to that fact . may be an even better arguement is that the general publics driving habits are the real reason for higher tire prices .',\n",
       " 'comment6031': 'this is a very well written and researched reply . the only objection that i have is that certainly in this area eastern wai have observed greater differences in tire prices than you have listed . for example at costco michelin xice 90 for 20570r15 michelin xice 100 for 20565r16 michelin xice 110 for 22560r16 each price includes 10 mounting etc charge so the real price is 80 vs 90 vs. 100. the 60 series tire costs 25 more than the 70 series tire . however assuming similar weights to the ones you listed the 60 series tire is probably 25 heavier than the 70 series tire so the cost for materials is equivalent . i agree with you that the higher speed rated tires cost more but believe that we dont need these high speed rated tires . around here and in kansas the state patrol are all over speeders . i would have a hard time justifying doing 80 mph . i also agree about brake size but dont really think there is a need to go over 16 wheels except for serious sports cars . it is the cost of progress i guess .',\n",

       " 'comment7272': 'i would not recomend it ... . several reasons why . the 23570r16 is what is recomended for the vehicle ... i say this knowing that i run a completly different size than what my vehicle recomends but ... . ill explain later . .i just did a quick check and a 23570r 16 tire is 29 inches tall . a 23565r 16 tire is 28 inches tall . this is a huge difference in the tire world and the way it will affect a vehicles performance.a 23665r16 is smaller tire . its diameter is less its load carrying capacity is lower depending on the tire but this statement is generally true because a 23565r16 will have less volume to distribute the vehicles load therefore its load carrying capacity is limited . if the tires load carrying capacity is less than what the vehicle recomends then like a previous poster said you will run the risk of overloading the tires and increasing the potential for tire failure . as as side note speed ratings are also important to consider . speed ratings can change as you change sizes but also change within the same size . make sure you stay with the recomended speed rating or greater . never go down in speed ratings . a speed rating is the speed a tire is capable of handling usually designated by a letter . there is a lot to how to read a tire but i will not go into it here . if interested edmunds might have a section on that i havent checked but also tirerack.com also has all sorts of useful info on how to read tires and such . back to what i was talking about ... because a 23565r16 has a smaller diameter it will throw off the speedometer readings . your actual speed will be less than what your speedodometer reads . which also means that your odometer will read more miles than are actually on the car . also the handling will be different . the suspension is setup for a 29 inch tall tire . i cant say for sure what it would do to the handling but the vehicle will respond differently to the 65 series tire as opposed to the 70 series tire with the same inputs from the driver.so there are all sorts of variables that are factored in when you change tire sizes . i would recomend you stick with the factory size . having said that i will tell you that i have switched from my recomended factory size to a different size . i have an 01 2wd excab s10 with 20575r15 stock size now i know you probably dont care but i will try and use this as an example of when it is possible to change from factory size . i was not happy with the way the tires handled or the way they gripped when i took off from intersections . i drive fairly aggressive and wanted something that would more suit my driving style . i switched to a 16 rim and i have run a 25555r 16 in the past and i am currently running a 23560r 16 now . i am now about to go back to the 25555r 16 tire size as i was much happier with the way the vehicle handled with that size . when changing the sizes i was careful to first not change the overall diameter of the tire . a 20575r15 and a 25555r16 and a 23560r16 have the same overall diameter . the 255 however is a much wider tire than a 205 or a 235. it volume is much greater and so its load carrying capacity is greater . it has the greatest load carrying capacity of the 3 sizes being compared . so it is capable of handling the wieght limits of the vehicle . it will also have a greater footprint on the road because of its width aiding in cornering and dry traction which is what i was looking for . it will not however handle as well on snow or ice or water because it is wider . since i live in a hot dry climate the ability to handle snow or ice was not a major factor for me . wieght of the a tirewheel combination different than factory is also another factor to consider . the 25555r16 is much heavier than the 20575r15 . more wieght at the axles could increase acceleration times and braking distances . it could possibly place more strain on the enginedrivetrain but since i felt that my drivetrain can handle the extra wieght it was not a major factor for me . i have not noticed a difference in braking distances either but that is a possibility with a heavier tire and wheel combination . the main thing i was after was better corning and acceleration traction . by switching to a wider tire and different wheel size i was able to maintain my goal . at the same time i was mindful to keep the overall diameter the same and not compromise the load capacity of the tire.for your particular case i however would recomend staying with the factory size . now for tire selection i think the firestone destinations that you mentioned would do you well for the price havnt had that much experience with firestones so cant be postive about it but after reading some reviews and specs i think that would be a good choice . not sure about the price since it is canadian but if it were american i would say way too high . hope this helped ...',\n",
       " 'comment7273': 'here is another option that you might entertain i just did a quick check prices and walmart does have a 19555r15 bfg traction ta for 88 plus installation at 9.76 a tire so roughly 98 bucks a tire getting you out the door for just under 4 hundred . still a lot of dough in my opinion for a grocery getter like you said but here is a way to shave some of the price . walmart will do tire matching and tire rack also has the traction ta and it is 80. print out this price and take it to walmart and they should match it . they just did so for me and i ended up saving almost 25 per tire i ordered a general grabber uhp and walmart can get them for 98 bucks a tire tire rack for 74. i printed out the quote took it in and asked if they would be able to match the price . they did so at 74 bucks a tire and i wasnt going to complain.here is my feeling on ordering tires from tire rack . take it for what it is worth . tire rack makes a great place for researching tires . but i have yet to buy from tire rack because once you boil it all down it is more convenient to get them at a regular tire store like discount tire or walmart . tire rack has great prices . but then you have to pay for shipping to get them . that often times as i price checked is the difference between the same tire at walmart . i.e . if the tire price is 74 it will cost me almost 14 per tire to ship bringing the tire price to now 88. this is better than walmarts 98 per tire 108 after protction plan which mounts and balances plus road hazard warranty . if you want to add tire racks protection plan which i am going to for fair comparison its another 8.88 per tire . total tire price for tire rack is now about 97 per tire . 11 less than walmart but that only gets the tires to your house . you now have to have them mounted on your vehicle . when i worked at walmart we charged 30 to mount and balance a set of carryin tires on a vehicle . this was discounted from the 44 to help us beat our competion . other tire dealers i do not know what they charge but i will stick with the walmart comparison . it can cost as little as 7.50 per tire to mount . if you need new valve stems as i recomend its another 1.75. so as little as 9.25 per tire to mount and balance properly . add that to the price of 97 per tire and it now equals out 106.25 per tire . a price difference of roughly 2 per tire . not really worth it for me to save 8 bucks on a 400 tire purchase . tire racks protection plan is a little more involved . when you get a flat you have to pay for the service and then they will reimburse you after you send them the bill . i would rather just take the flat to the store and have them fix it at no charge . same goes for rotations and balances . this might be different for stores that are approved by tire rack but not knowing i cant comment on that . so here it is broken down . i will use for example a 25555r16 general grabber uhp since this the tire i ordered from walmart.tire racktire cost 74 x 4protection plan 35.52shipping 56.02 this will vary depending on locationcost to mount at walmart 30.00valve stem 1.75 x 4total cost 424.24walmarttire cost 97.96 x

will only save you 6.64 on a 430 tire purchase . and that is assuming walmarts 30 mount price . it could be as high as 44. to me its not worth it . plus i was able to get walmart to price match tire rack . so here is what i paid.tire price 74 x 4protection plan 39.04total tire price 335.04savings 95.84. now that is worth it . do your research . it could save you some money . i would also check other tire dealers . i know i mentioned the traction ta but a previous poster said he had bad luck with them . the traction ta was just an example . it was also the only one on the walmart website that was costeffective . i would go to walmart and look at their special order books . they can get anything manufactured by goodyear bfg michilen general continental uniroyal . there ought to be several options . or better yet find a tire on tire rack made by a company that walmart will carry and take in that tire quote and ill bet walmart can get it . if you have trouble let me know and i know how to help them find it . the walmart i went to didnt think they could get the tire i ordered and i had to show them how to find it.if you find something like a kumho which are good tires or bridgstone or any other tire that walmart doesnt have or cant get you may have to try other places like discount tire or bigo tires . you might try the same strategy though of getting them to price match . you never know you could make out on a really good deal .',\n",

       " 'comment8569': 'ive never been really impressed with goodyear tires but that being said there are a lot of people on the forums that complain about sidewall bubbles supposedly from doing things like hitting curbs etc . with the stock tires . the nature of a runflat is that it tends to protect the rim of the wheel better than normal tires since it must prevent the tire from peeling off the rim when it loses pressure . while it somewhat depends on your deductable a broken rim normally is covered by your existing collision insurance and that may cover a bit of the cost of any eventual replacment . then the wear rating on the tires isnt all that great so theyll need to be replaced regularly anyway . this is more because bmw specs a higher performance tire than the fact they are runflats . for equivalent sizes it seems that a runflat tire costs in the order of 100 more than the conventional counterpart . the price you pay for not lugging a spare around and the safety of choosing where you stop if you do get a flat .',\n",

       " 'comment10026': 'think of a tire tread as having two sides left and right and a middle . think of a tire on the left side of the car . is the wear on the side of the tread that is more under the car or the side of the tread that is to the left outside of the car or both if it only on the outside of two tires sounds like there is indeed an alignment problem . if it is the outside and the inside of the tread and the middle of the tire is still pretty good it may be a tire air pressure problem . psiunless they are the run flat type of tire im thinking 800 to be way too much for the tire replacement . check with national tire and battery ntb kauffman tire sears etc for tires prices . my honda dealer said they would match any price . ntb had a price nearly 200 better and the dealer did reluctantly match itif they are the run flat tires they will be more expensive . not sure how many tire manufacturers make the run flats but my understanding is that real special attention is necessary to mount them properly . especially on a pilot.i rotate the tires every 0k or so . many people rotate more often than that . some dont rotate at all . seems to me that wheel alignment is done during one of hondas suggested maintenance services . 15k comes to mind . as your pilot is a 4wd they will likely align all 4 wheels . especially if tires are showing an unusual wear pattern . fwiw tire air pressure can cause unusual wear . generally speaking low pressure will generally show up on both the outside edge and the inside edge of the tread of a tire being worn while the middle of the tread is still good . excessive tire pressure will cause the middle of the tread to wear faster than the edges . on the drivers front door post jam there is a sticker with recommended tire pressure . that pressure will give the best ride handling and tire wear for the weight of the vehicle and occupants . the tire itself may also have 2 numbers . example one of them may say inflate to 32 psi cold . the other may say maximum pressure 44 psi . the 32 will likely be more in line with what is printed on the door sticker . the 44 is there to let you know that anything over 44 psi can blow the tire . example 2 if you had a vehicle that the door post recommended a tire pressure of 50 psi you would not want to use a tire that says 44 psi maximum pressure . on the other hand you dont want to put 44 psi in a tire when the door post calls for 32 psi . reason is that the tire would be so over inflated for the vehicle weight that the center of the tire tread would be doing all the work and wear faster than the two edges . with less tread touching the road you would also loose some handling lose some traction and have a much rougher and nosier ride . tire pressure should be checked on a regular basis . a tire that is set at 32 psi when the air temperature is 80 degrees may show as little as 27 psi when the weather is 30 degrees . and visa versa . so its real important to adjust the pressure when seasons change . kip',\n",

       " 'comment10301': 'i bought a 2008 highlander hybrid in november 2007. love the vehicle getting decent mileage avg about 2830 mpg in the summer a bit less in the winter . after noticing the poor tread remaining on my toyo a20s after about 9500 miles and sliding into a car going about 3 mph no damage fortunately on a very lightly snowcovered roadway i starting doing some research on the web.having read this thread i was motivated to call toyota . to make a monthlong story short i am very disappointed . the local dealers parts manager lead me to believe that toyota would buy two tires if i bought two tires but then they backed out when it came down to it . so when a planned trip came due i pulled the trigger and bought some 17 wheels with some michelin ltx ms from discount tire . i love these tires and they were put to the test during our weeklong trip . we had some snow and they performed beautifully on some dirt roads with moderate slopes . the sevenspoke wheels match the bolt pattern exactly and the difference in circumference from the toyos is negligible . i did my research beforehand and the michelin ltx is a very highly rated tire . im very glad to have made the switch . going forward i now have dozens of tires to choose from in the 17 size rather than the handful in the 19 size.the new tire size p24565r17bolt pattern 5114.3by the way discount tires tire calculator web page is great for calculating the difference between your current tire size and proposed tire sizes . it shows how the different size affects your speedometer and actual dimensional differences in circumference width etc . the page is located at httpwww.discounttire.comdtcsinfotiremath.dos . i used it extensively as i researched various options in going wider taller etc.the wheels i chose were 89 each and the tires were 194 each . after the road hazard replacement and other stuff that you pay with discount the grand total was around 1440. i will get 120 back from two rebates so a total of 1320. i will be putting the toyos and 19 rims on craigslist to try and recoup some of the cost . the rims cost 579 each from toyota ... over 2300 ill settle for less than half that if i can find someone interested . the salesman at discount tire said i would would probably be able to sell them . well see . the toyos have about 732nds left . the rims are in great shape and may appeal to another highlander owner who has already put some blizzaks on their original rims and are about to swap their toyos back on for the summer . if anyone here is interested let me know anyway i thought id share my story . i firmly believe that i made a good choice in buying the highlander . i believe its a superior vehicle and for some reason i thought that the company behind it was also superior to the traditional car companies i have dealt with in the past like ford chevrolet etc . clearly i was mistaken.if i encounter any other experiences with the wheels or tires ill post an update.thanks for reading .',\n",

far more than for some people on this forum . but theres absolutely no way im putting toyos on a vehicle of mine ever again zero traction in utah ice and snow and the bridgestone reviews here and on the tire rack site eliminated that choice . so ill be springing for new wheels to allow me reasonable tire choices.i visited the closest toyota dealer and see what options i had and what they had recommended to others in my position karl malone in salt lake . we visited there when we first started shopping and because of the salesmans attitude we never returned ; even though i was not happy with their salesman i figured the service org would be ok to deal with . wrong again.when i first raised the issue with the parts clerk he acknowledged that yes there are only the toyo and bridgestone tires available for that size wheel on the highlander but then went on to claim that no one had ever complained about this before . he then called in another guy from parts an older gentleman who listened to my complaint and then also stated no one had ever come in to karl malone about this issue . no one ever i pointed out that there are many angry customers venting about this online having learned about it like me only well after purchase when it came time to buy replacement tires and going back at least two years to nov 2006.his response 147 ; i can find people complaining about anything online148 ; thereby dismissing my complaint . i then asked about their recommendations for swapping wheels . the first parts clerk then went on to say 147 ; you cant move to 17148 ; wheels because they wont clear the brake calipers.148 ; yet people in this forum had already done this so i returned home to call the dealer where i purchased the vehicle as these guys where going to be zero help.on the way home i stopped at a discount tire store to ask them about this issue . their response 147 ; weve had a lot of highlander and tundra owners come in and complain about this very problem and many have in fact switched wheels . you can switch to 17148 ; or 18148 ; or even to a 20148 ; ; all will give you more and better tire choices . i just swapped out wheels replacing the originals with 17148 ; wheels on a highlander hybrid just like yours six months ago in our linden store.148 ; i returned home and called the dealer where i purchased the highlander to ask about the service bulletin referenced in this forum regarding the 18148 ; lexus port take offs but the service rep there did not know anything about said bulletin though he stated he was aware of the issue and could not find anything about it . since karl malone wasnt even aware of the problem there was no point in calling them.then i called the toyota experience department at 3104684000 150 ; what a waste of time that was . after collecting all my info including my phone and listening to my explanation of the problem the rep asked if he could put me on hold while he looked up the service bulletin i asked about ; i replied that was fine and since he had my number how he could call me back if somehow the call were dropped right 147 ; yes i can do that if the call drops148 ; . no problem ill wait . then he comes back on the line tells me he needs to transfer me to another department 147 ; the toyota experience department but for more technical issues148 ; and will i wait yes fine ill wait . then he comes back again and says 147 ; theyre all in a meeting but ive logged the details of your case so if you would just call back later you should be able to speak with them.148 ; uh what you have my phone number you have the details have them call me back when the meeting is over . 147 ; well no they cant do that.148 ; why not you have all the info you need and only you know when the meeting is over . 147 ; that isnt how our system works.148 ; what what kind of customer service is that i asked him to log my displeasure note that i was most certainly not calling back told him this doesnt constitute customer service in any form and hung up.ive got an inquiry in to international wheel and tire on ebay as they were the ones that posted the lexus 18148 ; wheelgoodyear forterra combo on ebay for 900 plus shipping 150 ; a total of about 1100 for four wheels and tires shipped to my homehttpcgi.ebay.comebaymotors18toyotahighlanderwheelsgoodyearforteratire s_w0qqcmdzviewitemqq_trksidzp1742q2em153q2el1262qqcategoryz66484qqihz001qqitemz1 10375199069qqtczphotoim going to visit discount tire again now that im armed with the proper info and see what combos they can offer for an 18148 ; wheel hopefully with a michelin tire for the same 275 per that i can get from the offer above ; once i make a decision ill report back along with my first impressions following the swap . and ive written up a much longer more detailed version of this posting which i intend to send via snailmail to toyota customer service at corporate along with ccing any toyota board members whose names i can turn up.two final thoughts 1 the guy from the toyota experience dept . noted that with regard to warranty violation they would only look at components and systems related to the wheels and tires ; for example any problems with the engine would not be traceable back to the tirewheel swap and therefore would not be voided.2 theres no point in waiting and hoping someone else will make a decent 19148 ; tires for this vehicle later this year or next michelins already said no according to one post in this forum ; sticking with the worthless toyo tires for another 25k miles would cost me about 180tire or 360tire for the next 50k miles . a good michelin or goodyear will last at least 50k so spending the same 360tire now 180wheel and 180tire gets me to better 150 ;

       " 'comment10510': 'im now 60 years old and ive bought quite a few tires . first off the tire warranty for x number of mileage is nothing but a marketing gimmick . hardly anyone but there are a few will get 80k on a set of tires and if you now read the fine print the dealers will only honor tire warranty from wear out if you can prove with receipt that the tires were rotated and balance every 5k . the cost to do this will out exceed the cost of a new set . diys that do it themselves do not count . everyone drives different and those who blow away from stop lights and turn hard will burn out any tires in short time . i once bought michelin x tires at costco rated at 80k for my wifes aerostar . at 36k they were well worn out and costco at that time prorated them and i go a new set for 125. at this time it came my van and when i sold it 50k miles later the tires were worn out . tire life also varies by the vehicle weight and the location in the country . different areas have more abrasive aggregate in the asphalt and hilly and mountainous areas also are harder on tires.the best indicator is the uniform tire rating . when the numbers are in the 300 range expect maybe 20k and with easy driving 30k the 400 range maybe 40k and the 500 range and above 50k max . therefore i like to buy tires of at least 460 and higher and alot of it depends on your budget on which ones to buy.another indicator i use is the rubber thickness of a new tire and the performance rating . so call high performance tires with high traction will not last at all . they are generally 932 of rubber and a softer compound for traction . regular passenger tires will usually have a max of 1132 of new rubber . cheaper tires will have the 932.another problem the tire shops have are the retired guys . they buy a new car at retirement keep it in the garage most of the time and after 8 years the 40k tires only have 25k on them but they are all dry rotted ozone damage and they expect new tires because the oem tires did not last . there is no warranty on this normal wear.ive bought cheap tires and expensive ones and the real indicator is the driver . so every place i read those who write and complain about how bad tires are first look in the mirror and start from there as what tires to buy next and what to expect.fyi on our highlander i rotated the tires every 10000 miles with the spare . on the oems we got 50000 when i had to replace them .',\n",

       " 'comment10768': 'thanks for the additional follow up . the travel in this vehicle is indentical to the travel in previous vehicles lexus gx470 lexus rx330 over the prior 12 years . the benefit of living and working at the same places over that same period . the tires on those cars never wore out prematurely but then again they were not goodyear brand and they were on different vehicles.i do understand warranties and gy has given us credit for the unused tires . in calculating backwards it turns out that the from the 22k mark to the current ~85k mark has cost us 166.56tire so while it is fairly aggravating to have to continually claim mileage credits at least they are there to keep the cost somewhat viable.i still think that this has something to do with the truck itself rather than our driving experience . during the fortera period toyota did perform a recall on the power steering rack on this particular car note the alignment was very tight to specs the entire time so should not have been a factor but who knows.since this recent post i have learned that there is speculation by other highlander hybrid owners that these tires may have been designed by toyota as too narrow as a way of getting better fuel economy at the penalty of better fuel mileage i.e . 225 may be too narrow to permit this vehicle to get the mfgs projected mileage out of them . perhaps it works ok for some who have extended periods of highway travel e.g . 1hr commutes to work or 4 hour trips to clients but for my wife who has a 35 minute drive down the interstate 4 days a week and then the balance of the time short jaunts hauling the kiddos around they just dont work the way they should . ill stop my rant now and go back to shopping for replacement tires . thanks again for the replies .',\n",
       " 'comment10787': 'i posted the following paragraph 5909 nearly 3 years ago and i still own the vehicle . i have switched between the 17 and 19 inch tires at every season change 6 changeovers so far and i have had no problems at all . i would suspect it is easier to find the base 17 inch wheels now that that the highlander has been out for quite a while but the bottom bottom line ... it is fine to go with the oem 17 inchers on a hl that came with 19s . and for what its worth ... i replaced my summer 19s with toyo versados and absolutely love them.original post i own an 08 sport with the 19 wheels . although they were hard to locate for a price i was willing to pay i finally found a set of 17 base wheels on ebay and they were delivered yesterday . i just had michelin latitude xice mounted on them and tested them on the highlander for fit . i always prep for winter and for years have bought my snow times in the late spring for very low prices i got these for 45 off . im pleased to say there is no problem with fit on the sport as many have claimed . the hubs calipers rotors and everything else that would matter are the same part number except for the strut on the sport so i had marginal concern . bottom line if you want to put oem highlander base 17 wheels on a vehicle with 19 factory wheels go for it and dont worry about a fit problem .',\n",
       " 'comment10821': 'im having 4 goodyear assurance cs tripletred installed monday morning on my 2010 limited . a local goodyear store is doing the entire job including an alignment check for very little more than just the tires and shipping from a big internet tire dealer . i thought the difference would more than the price of a couple of car washes.i talked with the sales guy two different days and he knows more about toyota tpms than i do . of course this is a suburban store in a high rent location so they probably see a steady stream of newer toyotas . the written estimate listed 4 new valve stems for a total of 20 or so and i asked about this charge vs. the much higher cost of new toyota tpms valves . this is their way of charging for dealing with the tpms hassle.fwiw i started out looking at the goodyear assurance cs fuel max model but the tripletred was rated a little higher and only cost a few dollars more.we will see.beachfish aka john',\n",
       " 'comment10822': 'thanks for the post on your goodyear tires . i have 2008 highlander limited and also bought the same tires . i have some tread left on the toyo tires currently on vehicle and have new ones in my garage until we get some winter type weather in michigan . ive had good luck with the assurance type of tires on past vehicle and they performed real well in snowicewet roads and provided a comfortable noisefree ride . got mine at local discount tire store and they honored tirerack.com advertised price of 231.00 per tire . got a rebate from discount tire coming to me as well in form of visa prepaid card for 100.00. interesting comment about the valve stems . discount tire wishes to install a tpms rebuild kit for 22.00 for 4 wheels . i may have them install good valve stems like you suggest . let me know how you like tires and thanks again for the post on these tires . wish us luck . finally a 19 inch tire that will hopefully provide troublefree driving instead of those darn toyo tires . never again but back then ... nobody had a decent 19 inch tire being offered in correct size for highlander ltd .',\n",
       " 'comment10825': 'greetings prior posting responsescomments are correct . some have had good luck with hankook but depends upon the modelstyle i guess . me i have 2008 limited and just purchased goodyear assurance cs version . found the tires on tirerack.com and my local tire shop discount tire honored the cheaper price per tire . presently i have toyo open country ht version with approx . 33k on them and they are ready to be changed out in preparation for michigan winter . original toyo tires open country were horrible on snow and ice and worn out at 24k . at the time toyo was only game in town having 19 inch tires so i was kinda forced to buy another set but that time i got the ht version and they have been just soso tires.i have had good luck with goodyear assurance tires on other vehicles on wet roads snow roads and it appears they have favorable reviews . one past poster indicated he too was putting them on his highlander . stay away from bridgestone duelers too noisy etc . another good way to review tires is go to local library and read the condensed version of consumers report magazine the 5x7 review book and make some informed decisions that way too . my goodyear tires will be mounted on vehicle in early november and will let you know how they handle in the snow and rain . might be too late for you though . appears you need tires now versus later ... happy shopping . tire websites often have reviews of owners of various tires too . ive heard good stories about michelin tires too but not hankook or bridgestone or toyo .',\n",
       " 'comment10829': 'i took a road trip to harrisonburg on the 30th to visit my mother at the nursing home and wish her a happy 88th . i didnt notice the tires and thats good ; they performed very well . its 263 miles round trip and ive done it regularly usually weekly since 207. i have no complaints at all about the tires or how the car handles . i drove back from harrisonburg with the sunroof open and a couple of windows partially open and didnt notice any objectionable tire noise even with the stereo off but i was doing 72 to 79 because 80 is reckless driving in va.i used the store at gaskins and broad . four tires cost me 1020.43 plus 69 for the 4wheel alignment i agreed to even though the free alignment check said it was borderline just within spec . i consider it insurance and i dont mean road hazard . that figure includes everything from mounting balancing and tax to disposal fees . and 4.90 for shop supplies but that would be there no matter who you pay to put them on.an on line place i checked would have been 948 plus 51 shipping for 4 tires . of course it can all change if there are rebates involved . there wasnt one on the tripletreds when i bought my tires but one on line dealer is now showing a 20tire mail in rebate.the local dealers know what the net stores are charging . i even went in with printouts . john',\n",
       " 'comment10833': 'greetings have you tried to look up tires in consumer reports magazine to see what the ratings of this entity have to say about your tire selection you can read the condensed version of most any item at local library in case you are not subscriber to consumer reports magazine . just as an fyi to you . have read your items of most concern regarding tread life etc . falls into same categories as my recent purchase of goodyear triple tred cs for my highlander ltd 2008. had these tires assurance on a pontiac bonneville before i got the highlander and they met all of my expectations as you noted in 123 above . however for a tire to meet all of the stated items above i doubt you will find them at less that 150.00 each . maybe if you watch local tire stores for rebates etc . i got my tires from local tire shop in michigan discount tire during labor day weekend sale plus they honored tirerack.com price of 214.00 per tire . on top of that discount tire company had 100.00 rebate 80.00 rebate from goodyear tire company . so at end of the day i got 4 tires for 214 each minus 100.00 from discount tire minus 80.00 from goodyear . not too bad of a deal.next would be these questions do you drive in snow how much longer do you plan to keep this vehicle if you plan to keep vehicle i would consider the tires to be a longtime investment in my a. safety b. handling and fuel efficiency rolling resistance and c. quiet ride . other poster put the goodyear tires on his highlander and believe he too has experienced same results . i have the goodyears installed for about one month and so far very satisfied . no snow driving yet but plenty of rain in michigan . so consider the tires to be an investment in your driving enjoyment and safety ... happy motoring .',\n",
